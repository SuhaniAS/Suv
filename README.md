# Based on the availabe data(Gender,age,estimated salary), predict whether the product will be purchased or not.
Hence the data is Supervised and deals with classification problem.
There are 400 rows and 5 columns.
The variable 'Purchased' is considered to be the target variable.
While preprocessing the data, we conver gender(categorical) to numerical using LabelEncoder.(This can also be done using replace method).
We use 75% of the data as Training data and the remaining 25% data for testing the model.
The Algorithms used are, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression Algorithm.
Based on accuracy score, we say that Naive Bayes Algorithm is better to use.
